If you are not sure which crystal you are most attracted to, you can find more than fifty types of Pendulums in the "Pandules" category of our site and choose the one you feel close to. Remember, the crystals you feel close to tell you more about your needs than you realize.

Since the magnetic fields of quartz group crystals such as Amethyst, Rose Quartz, Crystal Quartz are stronger, it will be easier for you to harmonize.</p>

    <p class="text">To harmonize your pendulum, you must first move to a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. After you are alone with your pendulum, take it in your palm and bring it to the level of your heart, imagining that the Pendulum energy is flowing to you and your energy is flowing to it, and after you are completely sure that your energy is harmonized: "I am removing all the blockages in front of me right now." Finish your attunement with a sentence that comes from your heart, such as:</p>
    <p class="text">If you do not use schematic cards in pendulum rituals, it usually starts by determining the directions for yes and no answers. You can use these aspects as “Swinging up and down means yes, right and left means no.” of course, but the more common waypointing method is “Show me the direction yes, show me the direction no.” or questions you already know the answer to, such as your hair color, and taking notes of the direction of movement of the pendulum. After doing this process, you need to ask your question clearly and clearly multiple times in different sentences. If you are completely sure of the answer to your first question, you can skip this step and move on to your next question.</p>
